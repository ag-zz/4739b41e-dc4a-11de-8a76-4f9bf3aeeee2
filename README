luabins -- Lua Binary Serialization Library

Allows save/load of tuples of primitive Lua types (including tables)
to binary chunks.

Luabins works with these Lua types:

-- nil
-- boolean
-- number
-- string
-- table (see below)

Luabins refuses to save these Lua types:

-- function
-- thread
-- userdata

Luabins intentionally does not save or check any meta-information
(versions, endianness etc.) along with data. If needed, it is to be handled
elsewhere.

Table save notes:

1. Metatatables are ignored.

2. Table nesting depth should be no more than LUABINS_MAXTABLENESTING.

3. On table save references are not honored. Each encountered reference
becomes independent object on load:

   local t = { 42 }
   { t, t }

becomes

   { { 42 }, { 42 } }

that is, three separate tables instead of two.

Luabins is still an experimental volatile software.
Please see source code for more documentation.
