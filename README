luabins -- Lua Binary Serialization Library

Allows save/load of tuples of primitive Lua types (including tables)
to binary chunks.

Luabins works with these Lua types:

-- nil
-- boolean
-- number (tested for default configuration only)
-- string
-- table (metatables are ignored; depth no more than LUABINS_MAXTABLENESTING)

Luabins refuses to save these Lua types:

-- function
-- thread
-- userdata

Luabins intentionally does not save or check any meta-information
(versions, endianness etc.) along with data. If needed, it is to be handled
elsewhere.
