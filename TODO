-- Extend test suite (see TODOs at the end of test/test.lua).
-- Document both C and Lua API.
-- Add a C API rudimentary test suite (with non-empty Lua stack).
-- Add "make test" target, must check both C89 and C++98 builds,
   both C and Lua tests.
-- Benchmark and see how fast it is compared to existing solutions.
-- Tag 0.1 and announce on Lua list.
-- Use own auto-growing char buffer instead of Lua stack on save.
   (Model it after Lua's ZIO?)
-- Enhance "corrupt data" message on load. Need more info on what is wrong.
