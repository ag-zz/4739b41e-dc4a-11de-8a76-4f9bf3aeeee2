-- Complete C API rudimentary test suite (with non-empty Lua stack).
-- Benchmark and see how fast it is compared to existing solutions.
-- Tag 0.1 and announce on Lua list.
-- Use own auto-growing char buffer instead of Lua stack on save
   (model it after Lua's ZIO?). Do not touch stack at all in luabins_save()
   (except to leave an error message).
-- Enhance "corrupt data" message on load. Need more info on what is wrong.
   Ensure every case is covered with tests.
-- Create Lua rock for the library.
-- Test makefile must detect when test.lua is changed.
-- When tests fail, second run of test makefile should re-run them.
-- Also some make install would probably be nice
